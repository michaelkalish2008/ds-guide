# SQL for Data Extraction
## Data Science Fundamentals with Cheese Manufacturing Database

## Topic
Database querying, complex data extraction, and SQL-to-pandas integration

## Summary
This lesson covers comprehensive SQL fundamentals for data extraction and analysis using the cheese manufacturing database. Students will learn to query the database effectively, perform complex joins across production tables, and integrate SQL with pandas workflows for seamless data science operations.

The lesson covers SQL basics, complex joins, aggregations, subqueries, and SQL-to-pandas integration. Students will work with the `cheese_manufacturing_batches` table (~496 records), `aging_lots` table (~5K records), `environmental_monitoring` table (~67K records), and other datasets to master database querying and data extraction techniques. This foundation is essential for accessing and preparing data for analysis.
