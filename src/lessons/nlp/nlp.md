# NLP Applications - Text Processing to Advanced Analysis
## Data Science Fundamentals with Cheese Manufacturing Database

## Topic
Comprehensive NLP applications: text processing, regex, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and document classification

## Summary
This comprehensive lesson covers all aspects of natural language processing (NLP) including text preprocessing, regex patterns, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and document classification using the cheese manufacturing database. Students will work with the `sensory_evaluations` table (~31 records) and related text data to master NLP techniques.

The lesson covers text preprocessing, regex pattern matching, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, document classification, and advanced NLP applications. Students will learn to process and analyze manufacturing documentation, quality reports, sensory evaluations, and regulatory documents to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data. This foundation is essential for analyzing customer feedback, quality reports, and regulatory documentation in manufacturing environments.
