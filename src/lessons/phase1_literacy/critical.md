# Critical Thinking with LLMs
## Data Science Fundamentals with AI Literacy

## Topic
Responsible use, bias awareness, fact-checking, and when to trust AI vs when to verify

## Summary
This lesson builds on LLM fundamentals to develop critical thinking skills for responsible AI usage. Based on "LLMs and Critical Thinking: An Inauthentic Phenomenon for Authentic Discovery," students will learn how to evaluate AI outputs critically, recognize bias and limitations, and develop strategies for responsible AI interaction. The hook "How to not get fooled by AI" emphasizes the practical importance of these skills.

The lesson covers bias detection, fact-checking strategies, responsible AI usage patterns, and developing a healthy skepticism while leveraging AI capabilities effectively. Students will learn to balance AI assistance with human judgment and critical evaluation.
