# What is an IDE

An **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** is a software application that provides comprehensive tools for writing, testing, and debugging code. Think of it as a "smart text editor" that understands programming languages and helps you write better code. It's for coding what google docs is for writing.

## Key Features of IDEs:
- **Syntax highlighting** - Code is colored to make it easier to read
- **Auto-completion** - Suggests code as you type
- **Error detection** - Points out mistakes before you run the code
- **Debugging tools** - Helps you find and fix problems
- **Integrated terminal** - Run commands without leaving the editor
- **Git integration** - Manage version control directly in the editor
