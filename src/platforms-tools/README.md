# What is an IDE

An **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** is your google doc interface, but for code. The flexibility and customization is endless, which can make it intimidating to use and explore. As your coding journey continues, you'll find more uses for its bells and whistles.

## Key Features of IDEs:
**Syntax highlighting** - Reading all code in black font is tough, IDEs bring color!
**Auto-completion** - Not always the best, but can be real handy when you know where you are going.
**Error detection / debugging** - Spot errors immediately! 
**Integrated terminal** - Run commands without leaving the editor
**Git integration** - This becomes useful as you learn about git!

# Code editors

### Cursor (Preferred)
Cursor is a modern AI-powered code editor built on top of VS Code. It includes advanced AI features to help you write code faster. This is my personal favorite. https://cursor.sh/

### Visual Studio Code (Free option)
It's free, made by Microsoft and one of the most popular IDEs for data science. Has Github Copilot for GenAI support. https://code.visualstudio.com/

### AI Capabilities:
Below are a few features offered by both.
- **Generate code** - Write functions, classes, and entire files
- **Explain code** - Get explanations of complex code
- **Debug assistance** - AI helps identify and fix bugs
- **Code optimization** - Suggestions for improving performance
- **Documentation** - Auto-generate comments and docs

### Advice when using AI
- **Slow down** - Tell your AI assistant to suggest step-by-step and to explain itself. You can set this as a rule in settings.
- **Avoid a "downward plunge"** - This is where your AI assistant spirals you farther way from understand its code suggestions to a point where you can no longer debug and become 100% reliant on it.
- **Enable auto-save** - Go to Cursor > Settings > VS Code Settings > Auto save and enable after delay. This defaults save to the default # of milliseconds.

# Shortcuts for Cursor
- **command shift p** to search your options
- **command k** for quick inline suggestions
- **command l** for side bar conversations with your assistant & more substantial edits
- **command b** for popping open your left hand side bar

# Extension
Below are a few extensions I like:
- **Pylance** (Microsoft) does a lot to enhance the visual experience of coding. Check out this youtube video to learn more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt91AHxUyMw
- **vs code live server** allows you to update your app as you saveÂ
